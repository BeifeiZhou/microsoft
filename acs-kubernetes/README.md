# Azure Container Service Kubernetes Demo

see it in action: 

## What is it

This project creates a docker image that enables you to rollout and manage a kubernetes cluster on azure. This automates the steps desribed in this article: https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/kubernetes.md ...This way you can give a cool demo in no time, of course you can also deploy the cluster directly via this template: <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-acs-kubernetes%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>
...but then you miss all the automation/ scripting stuff.

## HowTO

You need to be a able to create and docker image on your local machine.
* git pull 


## How does it work
